# Newt
An open source minimal web browser, built for a safer, cleaner, and faster experience surfing.

**Currently under development.**

## About Newt
**Newt is a web browser that allows you to search the web knowing safety features are in place.**

Newt was primarily built only for the use of the [CustomNewTab](https://github.com/polardev-ui/newtab) extension, built by me.

Newt is **currently** powered by SearXNG. This is not permanent, and will change in the future.
